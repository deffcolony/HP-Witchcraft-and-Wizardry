## Getting help

The [wiki](https://github.com/deffcolony/HP-Witchcraft-and-Wizardry/wiki) is currently being put together to explain a number of functions within the map, however most are pretty simple to understand through tips and added descriptions.

If there is a section missing from the wiki currently that you'd like to see added, feel free to open an issue on GitHub and it will be prioritised.

As this is a live project and something we developing in our free time, certain things may be unfinished or temperamental. Any in-development sections of the tools will always be labelled as such!
